This is a port of my i960Sx chipset to the raspbery pi 400.

After getting the Atmega 1284p up and running, I realize that the turn around time for setting things up is far slower than I want. Things such as:

1) RAM 
2) ROM
3) Display

Are all usable on the 1284p but I find the extra overhead of using the sd card for ram and rom slowing things down and has been making it harder to solve problems.
